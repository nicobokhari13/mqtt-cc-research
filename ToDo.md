# To Do
- create randomAssignmnetGeneration in proto_client
- create RRAssignmentGeneration in proto_client
- create RRBatteryAssignmentGeneration in proto_client
- create NoAlgoAssignmentGeneration in proto_client
- create testbedAssignmentGeneration 
  - Change pub_utils to calculate power consumption (V * I) = W
  - If exp_type is testbed, proto_utils should keep track of remaining battery capacities. Status Handler handles the battery metric differently by substracting battery value from remaining capacity, record power_instant AND remaining_battery
- include generation types in env setup script
- 
- Approaches (Vary # topics, Vary # publishers, Vary randomness of subscriber latencies)
  - No algorithm (no lat Qos and no selection, all publishers publish where they are capable)
  - RR (yes lat Qos selection = ordered)
  - Random (yes lat Qos, selection not ordered)
  - Algorithm (same energy_executions + algorithm rerun)
- Contribution
  - Test Bed
  - Varying the conccurrent_execution_thresholds
